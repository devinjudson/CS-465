Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Architecture**
In my full stack project, I used multiple frontend approaches: Express-generated HTML, plain JavaScript, and an Angular single-page application (SPA). Express and JavaScript followed a traditional server-rendered model, suitable for simpler applications but limited in interactivity. In contrast, the Angular SPA provided a dynamic, seamless user experience by updating views without full page reloads, making it ideal for building a modern, feature-rich app.

The backend used MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-based format (BSON). Its structure aligned naturally with JSON, allowing for easy integration with the API and frontend. MongoDBâ€™s flexibility and scalability made it the best fit for an evolving full stack application.

**Functionality**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) differs from JavaScript by serving solely as a lightweight format for data exchange. In my project, JSON connected the Angular frontend to the Express backend by structuring data for API requests and responses.

Throughout development, I refactored repeated UI elements into reusable Angular components. This reduced code duplication, improved maintainability, and ensured a consistent user experience across the application.

**Testing**
API testing involved verifying GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods using tools like Postman to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend. Adding JWT-based authentication introduced challenges, which I addressed by testing protected endpoints and simulating secure user roles. Thorough testing helped ensure both functionality and security across the app.

**Reflection**
This course helped me build real-world full stack development skills, including API integration, database management, and secure authentication practices. I also strengthened my abilities in modular coding and thorough testing. These skills have made me a more confident and competitive candidate for software development roles.
